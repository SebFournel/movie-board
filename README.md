# Prerequisites  
**Please, consider to follow and apply the following points on your laptop before coming to the codelab**

*   to have a modern browser (it has been tested with Chrome 32.0, Firefox 26.0, Safari 6.1)  

Then download the compressed archive of this project by clicking the download button on the right side of this page (or fork the project if you are confortable with GitHub) and finaly uncompress it on your laptop.

**Important: the `user-story-final` directory contains the final application, so don't try to have a look to files in this directory: Cheating is not playing !**
